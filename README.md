I'm a guy who thinks computers are cool. I'm currently at UWI St. Augustine for a BSc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

### General Interests
- Functional Programming
- Tech talks
- Skyrim (modding)
- Nix/NixOS

### Programming Languages
- Current Interests
  - Rust - My current main experimentation programming language. Given its current popularity, there are a lot of things written in it that I use, such as:
    - [Zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij)
    - [Czkawka](https://qarmin.github.io/czkawka/)
    - [nushell](http://nushell.sh/)
    - [starship](https://starship.rs/)
    - [rip](https://github.com/nivekuil/rip) (Trash doesn't work on my NixOS setup due to impermanence, which sets up a bunch of bind mounts)
  - Zig - It's like C, but fancier. The metaprogramming stuff is amazing. The "youth" of the language does make some things inconvenient/less obvious at first, but it has a lot of potential.
  - Go - Haven't tried it yet, but the syntax seems super easy to learn/use.
  - Nix - I use this for my main desktop. It's super convenient, and once it's set up right, it just works. And rollbacks are a lifesaver.
- Prior Experience
  - JavaScript - First language I started properly learning to code with. Tended to hack around with it a lot.
  - C/C++ - Mostly for school assignments & a bit of embedded programming (on Arduino & ESPs).
  - .NET (C#/F#) - Discovered F# while googling random stuff, learned about functional programming using it, and later learned C#.
  - Powershell - I use powershell to automate miscellaneous stuff when I use Windows. Super easy to script with.
  - Fish - Currently my shell of choice on GNU/Linux.
